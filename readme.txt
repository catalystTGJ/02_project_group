Group project proposal:

Tank battle game allowing 4 players to participate in a match.
Users will login to the server, and select a match to join.
The match will then be generated for 4 players.
the server will have a wait state until all players are connected.
The front-end will communicate to the back-end using ajax method to communicate all the relevant telemetry of the player's tank,
and any damage inflicted on other player's tanks.



nice to haves
obstacle objects on the battle field that will interfere with tank movement and/or turret fire
